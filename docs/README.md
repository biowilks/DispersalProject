# docs

 This directory contains all the HTML files for your website. The HTML files are built from the R Markdown files in 
analysis/. Furthermore, any figures created by the R Markdown files are saved here. Each of these figures is saved
 according to the following pattern: docs/figure/<insert Rmd filename>/<insert chunk name>-#.png, where # corresponds
 to which of the plots the chunk generated (since one chunk can produce an arbitrary number of plots)3.
