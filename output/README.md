# Output

Here are all the processed data files needed for analyses in the paper (doi:XXXX): 



- **DispersalTransformed.csv** contains maximum dispersal distances for birds, mammals and fish needed for comparision with the bioenergetic dispersal model predictions of maximum dispersal distance. 



- **flydispdistance.csv**,**rundispdistance.csv** and **swimdispdistance.csv** contains the bioenergetic dispersal model predictions of maximum dispersal distance for each locomotion mode, respectively. 



- **taxonomy_gbif_match.csv** shows the phylum, class, famliy and genus of each species matched in the data harmonisation and the status and matchType of the process. See [2-disp-raw-data-transformation](https://github.com/biowilks/Energy-Budget-Model/blob/master/code/2-disp-raw-data-transformation.R)
