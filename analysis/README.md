# analysis

This directory contains all the source R Markdown files for implementing the data analyses for your project.
It also contains a special R Markdown file, index.Rmd, that does not contain any R code, but will be used to generate 
index.html, the homepage for your website. In addition, this directory contains the important configuration file _site
.yml, which you can use to edit the theme, navigation bar, and other website aesthetics (for more details see the 
documentation on R Markdown websites). Do not delete index.Rmd or _site.yml.
